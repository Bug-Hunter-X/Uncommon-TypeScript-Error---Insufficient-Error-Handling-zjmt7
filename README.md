# Uncommon TypeScript Error: Insufficient Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a simple TypeScript program with inadequate error handling. The `divide` function throws an error if the divisor is zero, which is good. However, the program lacks robust error handling for more complex scenarios.  This example highlights the importance of considering edge cases and implementing comprehensive error management in TypeScript applications.

## Bug Description:
The current code only handles the `Division by zero` error.  More sophisticated error handling would involve checking for non-numeric inputs, handling potential exceptions from external calls, logging errors appropriately, and using more informative error messages.  This example lacks these features.

## Solution:
The improved version includes enhanced error handling, which is described in the `bugSolution.ts` file. This approach addresses potential issues and makes the code more robust and maintainable.
